    "The RF-DAC tiles available on the RFSoC each contain two RF-DAC blocks which can be used to transmit, or Digital Up Convert (DUC) an information signal. This is the process of modulating a low frequency baseband information signal with a high frequency carrier signal. This is performed using Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and a mixer is utalised to modulate the baseband information signal. Similarly, the RF-ADCs act as a receiver, performing Digital Down Conversion (DDC) on the received high frequency signal. Once more mixers are used to demodulate the signal to reconstruct the original baseband information signal.\n",

    "The **Coarse Mixer** component implements both the **Coarse** mode and the **Bypass** mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **Coarse** mode, the mixer is able to demodulate using only a very restricted set of frequencies, however it is able to operate in this mode with lower power than in Fine mode. This is because sine and cosine waves at these frequencies comprise a very limited set of samples. Three options are available in this mode: $\\frac{f_{s}}{4}$, $-\\frac{f_{s}}{4}$ and $\\frac{f_{s}}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **Bypass** mode, the signal path simply bypasses the I/Q mixing stage, via the coarse stage, and does not undergo any modulation/demodulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequencies of $\\frac{f_{s}}{4}$ and $-\\frac{f_{s}}{4}$ are useful for modulating/demodulating to a quarter of the sampling frequency with absolutely minimal cost. The NCO must generate only four samples per sine wave cycle: 0, +1, 0, -1. It is trivial to store these values and to multiply another signal by them for modulation/demodulating. Multiplying by 0, +1 and -1 is trivial, and therefore the modulator or demodulator architecture can be simplified to a counter and some simple combinatorial logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Fine Mixer** component implements **Fine** mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **Fine** mode, the mixer uses an NCO, which can generate any arbitrary frequency between $-\\frac{f_{s}}{2}$ and $\\frac{f_{s}}{2}$. This is done by setting a step size input to the phase accumulator (automatically calculated in the design tools), the lookup table size and the desired frequency. Optional additional parameters can be set, including a phase adjustment and added dithering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mixer operates on the concept of heterodyning. When we mix two signals, we obtain two signals; one at $f_{1} + f_{2}$ and another at $f_{1} - f_{2}$. Generally one of these signals is useful, and the other is filtered out by a lowpass filter."

    "This notebook has presented a simple introduction to the Mixer Settings available using the RF Data Converters of the RFSoC2x2 using interactive plots to allow the user free control over the Coarse and Fine mixer modes in a design running on the RFSoC2x2 board. Additionally the theory of Bypass mode. \n",
